# Rock-Paper-Scisors
TheOdinProject Rock-Paper-Scisors. 

The game will involve user graphical interface vs Bot.


What I learned in this project?
I learned how to take the elementid, queryselector, and be able to use it in the code.
Mainly things related to addeventlistener click,
Audio first time usage,
How to make the random value for bot, and be able to return it with playerchoice,
Write basic function about gamerules,
Creating functions about alerting notifications in specify scenarios,
And many things related to logical structure of the game(RoundChecker,ResetGame)

Mainly I learned how to think what to focus on about when you're creating game.
Overall, usefull exercise, learned alot, feeling more comfortable with js.


// some fixes - last update
The thing what I have fixed in the last commit, was styling. I have updated the anime mode, so it shows correctly in the corners while in the game instead of ruining the graphics. Also i've hided bot ui menu, since it's unecessary, after that, some minor fixes not worth mentioning.
